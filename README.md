# 🧠 Racism Exposure Estimator

Using **machine learning**, we've developed a predictive model that estimates an individual's likelihood of facing discrimination.  
The goal is **not** to promote division, but to **raise awareness** and provoke thoughtful discussion about unconscious bias and systemic inequities.

## 📊 About the Project

This project explores how societal perceptions—based on physical appearance, nationality, and other external attributes—might influence discriminatory experiences. 

The model was trained on a dataset built with **genuine research and careful consideration**. It **does not include any fabricated or biased data points**.  
We emphasize: the model reflects observable **trends**, not **moral truths**, and **must not** be used to label individuals or make decisions about real people.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **This is a delicate topic.**  
> We urge all users to approach this tool with **empathy**, **humility**, and **understanding**.  
> Our goal is to **educate**, **inform**, and promote thoughtful reflection—not to stereotype or judge.

## 🧬 Key Features Used in Prediction

- **Skin tone**, **nationality**, and **accent** were found to be the **strongest influencing factors**.
- Additional features include:
  - **BMI**
  - **Hair texture**
  - **Fashion style**
  - **Gender presentation**
  - **Religious symbols**
- These variables were chosen based on insights from **sociological studies** on bias and perception.

## 🛡️ Ethical Considerations

- No **personal** or **sensitive** real-user data was used.
- The model runs in a **simulated environment** purely for **educational** and **awareness-raising** purposes.
- Predictions are not definitive, and should not be interpreted as facts.
